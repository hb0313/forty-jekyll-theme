<h2 id="content">Introduction</h2>
<p>
Growing up in the west-central regions of India, I developed a keen interest in the evolution of computer science, especially with the advancements in technology. This passion led me to pursue a graduate degree in Computer Science at Binghamton University in New York State. Throughout my academic journey, I focused on expanding my expertise through key courses such as Cloud Computing, Operating Systems, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, High-Performance Computing, and Computer Organization and Architecture.

Having successfully completed my graduate studies, I am now employed as a Data Engineer at Insight Global. In my current role, I apply my knowledge and skills to contribute to the dynamic field of data engineering, leveraging the foundation I built during my academic pursuits.</p>

		<h3>Professional Experience</h3>
		<p>Growing my career in the B2B-B2C SaaS industry for nearly 2.3 years, I accumulated a wealth of experience in various verticals. Driven by a desire to further enhance my skills, I made the decision to pursue a Master's degree. In my previous role, I demonstrated a strong sense of responsibility by excelling in problem-solving, bug fixing, research and development, effective communication, and end-user training.

As a dedicated team member, I took on the responsibility of providing on-floor training to new joiners, offering solutions to common problems, and assisting my colleagues. Additionally, I diversified my experience through an internship and co-op as an AI/ML Engineer for a year, further enriching my skill set. On top of that, I have obtained Azure certifications (Az900, DP203) and possess a robust understanding of generative AI, having worked on models such as BART, GPT, BERT, RoBERT, and more.

Furthermore, my expertise extends to designing and scaling applications on the cloud and virtualization, making me well-equipped to tackle challenges in the ever-evolving landscape of technology..</p>

		<h3>Academic Experience</h3>
		<p>Embarking on my computer science journey in 2011, I enrolled at MIT to pursue a diploma degree. The inception of my fascination with virtualization and systems occurred during the final project. Subsequently, in 2019, I earned a bachelor's degree in computer science from Pune University, where my focus on developing virtualized applications was nurtured through substantial projects and departmental support. This passion led me to pursue specialization, and I successfully completed my master's degree in 2023.

During my master's program, I had the valuable opportunity to work as a Research Assistant for The Research Foundation for SUNY (State University of New York Binghamton University), further enriching my academic and practical experiences..</p>
