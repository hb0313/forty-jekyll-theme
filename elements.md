<h2 id="content">Introduction</h2>
<p>I grew up in India's west-central regions, and as technology advanced, it became clearer and clearer to me that I wanted to learn about the evolution of computer science. As a graduate student in Computer Science at Binghamton University in New York State, I intend to broaden my knowledge with major courses such as Cloud Computing, Operating Systems, and Design and Analysis of Algorithms, High Performance Computing, Computer Organization and Architecture.</p>

		<h3>Professional Experience</h3>
		<p>After working in various verticals of the B2B-B2C SaaS industry for almost 2.3 years, I decided to move and start my career with Master's. As a responsible employee I gained proficiency in problem-solving, bug fix, research and development, communication, and end-user training. As a team member, I delivered on-floor training to new joiners, provided solutions to genric problems, and assisted other colleagues as well.</p>

		<h3>Academic Experience</h3>
		<p>My  journey as a computer science student began in 2011 when I enrolled in MIT to earn a computer science diploma degree. My interest in  virtualization and systems was first developed while working on the final  project. Then, in 2019, I graduated from Pune University with a bachelor's degree in computer science. My focus on developing virtualized applications was facilitated during  major projects and supported by department.</p>
