<h3><em>"A Survey on real-time Application Latency based on Android OS"</em></h3>
<h6><i>Conference proceeding - <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8697738">IEEE Xplore</a></i></h6>
<h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>The efficiency of response time in any computing device is of vital importance. This is especially true in the real-time operating system, where an adequate latency time allows proper reaction from user to the occurring phenomena by the system. According to Quality of Service (QoS) analysis, latency is clearly high in the traditional operating system (OS) like Android. It is primarily presented as the core performance of a system. Referring to the touch action of an Android operating system, latency to the touch response should be less to get better performance. The term Latency is understood as the lag time from input into a system to the desired output; this term is understood slightly different in a range of contexts and latency issues also fluctuate from one system to another. The latency of a memory is the total time (or clock cycles) taken by a system in responding to a command request. When there is low latency, the response time of memory becomes faster. The latency of a network, operating system (audio, video, applications etc.) and the other electronic systems becomes noticeable approximately after 100ms. The paper reviews the methods to improve the latency time of Android and optimization of the system to get better performance when using touch-enabled Android devices.</p>

<h4><em>"Pi-Cloud: Smart Personal Cloud for Corporate and Educational Institutes"</em></h4>
<h6><i>Journal proceeding - <a href="https://hb0313.github.io/BECS/">MD Infotech Special Edition</a></i></h6>
<h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>Dev server is a kind of server that is intended to extract the advancement and testing of projects, sites, applications for programming developers. It gives a constant domain and all programming utilities that are expected in troubleshooting the code. Development server with raspberry-pi is the hub of a product improvement condition, where programming engineers can precisely test the code. It is involved with the required tools, programming and different parts that are used to send and test any product on which we are working, while testing is finished, the application is moved either to an organizing server or the generation server. In a facilitated programming condition, an improvement server refers to a server level that is assigned to a particular stage in a discharge procedure. Some different instances of levels are Local, Integration, Test/Quality Assurance(QA), UAT, Pre-creation, and Production.</p>

<h4><em>"Exploring Recession Indicators: Analyzing Social Network Platforms and Newspapers Textual Datasets"</em></h4>
<h6><i>Conference proceeding - 2nd International Conference on Applied Data Science and Smart Systems</i></h6>
<h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>Social Media platforms are widely used for transmitting data in different formats. We can generate a lot of information on recent trends. We have collected data from two social networking sites, Twitter and Reddit as public-based platforms. We have also collected data from new articles based on data sources such as New York Times API. Twitter is a public social networking domain and Reddit is a community-based social media platform. The primary aim of this project is to analyze the social media-associated data which predicts the conditions which lead to the Recession over time. Secondly, for the third dataset, we evaluated the news article which contains the topic of recession and economic crisis. techniques to understand the data in a better context. In project phase 3, we have developed a web-based dashboard that will allow for interactive querying.</p>
